#The __init__() Method
#All classes have a built-in method called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
#The __init__() method is used to assign values to object properties,
#or to perform operations that are necessary when the object is being created.
#Create a class named Person, use the __init__() method to assign values for name and age:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("Emil", 36)
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
#The __init__() method is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.
#Without the __init__() method, you would need to set properties manually for each object.

#Default Values in __init__()
#You can also set default values for parameters in the __init__() method.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age=18):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
p1 = Person("Emil")
p2 = Person("Tobias", 25)
print(p1.name, p1.age)
print(p2.name, p2.age)

#Multiple Parameters
#The __init__() method can have as many parameters as you need.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age, city, country):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.city = city
    self.country = country
p1 = Person("Linus", 30, "Oslo", "Norway")
print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
print(p1.city)
print(p1.country)
