#INHERITANCE
#nheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

#Create a Parent Class
# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:
# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method.
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname
  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

#Use the super() Function
# Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:
# Example
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
#By using the super() function, you do not have to use the name of the parent element,
#it will automatically inherit the methods and properties from its parent.
